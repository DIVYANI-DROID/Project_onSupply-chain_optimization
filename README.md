Supply Chain Optimization: Automated a supply chain for the purchasing decisions using ML on AWS (SageMaker)         Feb 2021 – Current Manipulated the data from the S3 bucket to understand graphs and performed a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). Built a prediction model for 5 months in the future with a context length of 12 months. Designed a data pipeline architecture that enabled access to the structured dataset for analytics. Picked DeepAR Forecasting algorithm over ARIMA, which just takes one time series and draws predictions based on it, whereas the former considers every time series to make a more considerate prediction model that includes outcomes based on each time series.
